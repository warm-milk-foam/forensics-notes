#  What is forensics? #
- Digital forensics is the analysis of files, as an extremely broad definition

## Why should I learn forensics? ##
- Relatively easy to learn (Low skill floor)
- Mostly reliant on what tools you use
- Easy way to earn points during CTF

## What tools do I need to learn forensics ##
- As most other CTF challenges require; a linux distro or a terminal emulator to run CLI commands
- (If you do not know what linux is, it is a free and open-source operating system kernel that can allow you to run tools in this guide for the sake of CTF'ing)
- If you are on windows, it will NOT suffice for you to Command prompt (maybe you could but I rather not)
Instead, you can install Windows Subsystem For Linux (WSL) by following this: <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install>
- On the other hand, if you want a full system of linux, you have 2 options
1) Dual Boot (aka; installing a linux operating system on your computer), probably not a good choice if you have no clue what you are doing
2) Running a linux distro on a Virtual Machine (VM) - What this means is that linux will run directly on your windows system, and is much safer (What I would recommend to new players)
 
There are many kinds of Linux distros (aka different variants of linux), if you are complete beginner. In which case, I advise to seek out the one you would like to use

But for the sake of simplicity, one reliable linux distro would be ubuntu
You can install ubuntu here <https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/how-to-run-ubuntu-desktop-on-a-virtual-machine-using-virtualbox#1-overview>
