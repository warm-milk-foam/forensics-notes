#  What is forensics? #
- Digital forensics is the analysis of files, as an extremely broad definition

## Why should I learn forensics? ##
- Relatively easy to learn (Low skill floor)
- Mostly reliant on what tools you use
- Easy way to earn points during CTF

## Why should I NOT learn forensics ##
- Can be incredibly guessy
- Incredibly cumbersome and exhausting when your tools decide to crash out
- That's why I'm writing this guide, so you can 'minimise' your suffering having to scrap the internet for tools, trash guides (I cannot speak for myself), lack of information when you need it

## What tools do I need to learn forensics ##
- As most other CTF challenges require; a linux distro or a terminal emulator to run CLI commands
- (If you do not know what linux is, it is a free and open-source operating system kernel that can allow you to run tools in this guide for the sake of CTF'ing)
- If you are on windows, it will NOT suffice for you to Command prompt (maybe you could but I rather not)   
Instead, you can install Windows Subsystem For Linux (WSL) by following this: <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install>
- On the other hand, if you want a full system of linux, you have 2 options
1) Dual Boot (aka; installing a linux operating system on your computer), probably not a good choice if you have no clue what you are doing
2) Running a linux distro on a Virtual Machine (VM) - What this means is that linux will run directly on your windows system, and is much safer (What I would recommend to new players)
   
There are many kinds of Linux distros (aka different variants of linux), if you are complete beginner. In which case, I advise to seek out the one you would like to use

But for the sake of simplicity, one reliable linux distro would be ubuntu:  
<https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/how-to-run-ubuntu-desktop-on-a-virtual-machine-using-virtualbox#1-overview> 

This is because some of the commands I may use would be specific to debian-based linux distros.   
What this means is that some of these commands may not work on other distros, because they use different services and functions to work

Thank you! I hope this guide will show you the information and techniques you might need.
