# Chapter 2: The bare essentials #
### A few common bases you would need to know ###
1) Base 2 aka binary: consists of 0s and 1s, where 8 of these make up a character
- E.g. 'a' is `0110 0001`
- One of the ways where information can be hidden

2) Base 10 aka numeric system: 1-10
- Its just the normal way that people count irl
- Just a good thing to know so that you can differentiate them from the other bases
- Text can sometimes appear in this form as in ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange)
- Some text like "Hello" can be displayed as `72 101 108 108 111 10`

3) Base 16 aka hex
- 16 base numbering system (0-9, A-F)
- Basically `A → 10, B → 11, C → 12, D → 13 E →14 F → 15`
- Starts at 0 because computers are 0-indexed (aka first item start at 0)
- ASCII text can aslo rely on hex, where "Hello" can be displayed as `48 65 6C 6C 6F 0A`

4) Base 64
- 64 characters are used to encode stuff
- Can usually be found through the '==' at the back
