#  Chapter3: Image analysis #
Often, you will be given an image to analyse for a flag. What can you do?  

## Magic bytes ##
- You would know that these is the case when the image does not open properly
- Magic bytes are basically bytes of a file that will tell you what kind of file it is
- To see magic bytes, you can use a online tool called [hexed.it](https://hexed.it/) or you can do in the terminal with multiple hex editor tools that exist out there

As you can see, one of the 2 character chunks is a byte (represented in hex format) such as the highlighted '89'  

But sometimes, these files are 'broken' because the magic bytes are completely wrong

- PNG files have:  
1) 8 byte file header `89 50 4E 47 0D 0A 1A 0A` -> Tells the computer it is a PNG file
2) IHDR (Image Header chunk) -> Gives size and other metadata of the PNG
3) IDAT (Image data chunk) -> Multiple of these are found throughout the PNG; they contain the actual image data which is to be displayed
4) IEND (Image End chunk) -> Marks the end of the PNG data; the chunk's data field should be empty

There is also extra information [here](http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/spec/1.2/PNG-Chunks.html), if you want to learn more

- JPEG files are like the same, but they only have one extremely long data chunk

They can have different header signatures too

## If the image renders ##
Then there are two other ways:
1) The flag is hidden inside the image in a file
2) The flag is hidden in plain sight

If the flag is hidden in a embedded file, there are many waves to approach this problem  
1) 



However, if the flag could be hidden in plain slight:
