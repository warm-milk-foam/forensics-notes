#  Chapter7: Wireshark #
A staple of forensics challenges is network challenges  
So you would often see a .pcap challenge - its automatically Wireshark as your main investigation tool      
Depending on how cheeky the challenge creators want to be, it can be from:
- Just find the string and win
- Advanced problems, like WPA key cracking, DNS tunneling, any networking related issue that requires actual knowledge in the area
   
In this lesson I hope to teach you about:
1) Network packets, the different types and what you should look out for
2) Important functionalities of wireshark that proves useful
3) Some advanced networking methods which I learn while typing these notes

## Installing wireshark!! 
- Install wireshark from https://www.wireshark.org/download.html depending on whether you are on Windows, Mac, etc
- There is a command line version called `tshark` though I won't delve into that
