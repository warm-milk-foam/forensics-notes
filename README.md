# Forensics-notes
- A beginner-friendly, dumbed down, forensics notes targetted towards CTF challenges
- I made this so as to provide a more comprehensive guide to approaching challenges, plus I am trying to learn Markdown and I want to do something productive
- This guide will take information from many sources just so I can create a guide for just about everything in that section
- Disclaimer: I suck at CTFing, so this guide may miss out relevant information/get things wrong
