# CTF Forensics-notes
- An extremely simple, easy-to-understand guide to forensics (specifically for Capture-The-Flag challenges), based on my experience, so that you can kind of read it like a book and understand most of the concepts (or at least i aim to make it that way)    
- I made this so as to provide a more comprehensive guide to approaching challenges, plus I am trying to learn Markdown and I want to do something productive
- This guide will take information from many sources just so I can create a guide for just about everything in that section
- This is largely inspired by my friend Ryan who has own notes at <https://github.com/Milo-sipper/forensics-101> but is incomplete, so I want to finish what he couldn't
